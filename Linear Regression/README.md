This project predicts house sale prices using data from the Kaggle “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques” competition. It consists of a complete end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It uses Linear Regression as the base model. The Project workflow consists of the following steps

1. Dataset loading
2. Feature separation
3. Feature Categorization
4. Preprocessing pipelines
5. Model pipeline
6. Model training and evaluation
7. Submission file generation (for kaggle)

Libraries used
1. Pandas for data manipulation
2. Numpy for numerical operations
3. Scikit-learn for Preprocessing, modeling and evaluation

This project provides a reproducible and modular workflow for future model upgrade (for ex: adding Ridge or Lasso regression, RandomForestRegressor)
