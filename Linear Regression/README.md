This project predicts house sale prices using data from the Kaggle “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques” competition. It consists of a complete end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It uses Linear Regression as the base model. The Project workflow consists of the following steps

Dataset loading
Feature separation
Feature Categorization
Preprocessing pipelines
Model pipeline
Model training and evaluation
Submission file generation (for kaggle)
Libraries used
Pandas for data manipulation
Numpy for numerical operations
Scikit-learn for Preprocessing, modeling and evaluation

This project provides a reproducible and modular workflow for future model upgrade (for ex: adding Ridge or Lasso regression, RandomForestRegressor)
